# Prepare a Plugin

Plugins are packages of `Tools` and `Hooks`, you don't distribute a `Tool` or a `Hook` directly, you will distribute a Plugin containing them.

## Creating the new plugin
In this step we will use a GitHub template to prepare an empty Plugin and in the next steps we will insert a `Tool` and a `Hook` inside.

Navigate to the [plugin-template](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/plugin-template){:target="_blank"} GitHub repository, click on `Use this template` and then `Create a new repository`:

Choose `poetic_sock_seller` as repository name and then click on `Create repository`:

## Cloning the Plugin
Now that you set up the remote repository on GitHub, you need to set up the code locally. Hence, clone the repository directly in the Catâ€™s plugins folder on your machine:

``` shell
cd core/cat/plugins
git clone https://github.com/[your_account_name]/poetic_sock_seller.git
```

Finally, run the setup.py script to customize the repository:
``` shell
cd poetic_sock_seller
python setup.py
```

The script will prompt you to write the name of your plugin, `Poetic Sock Seller`, the output in the terminal should looks like:

The template contains a source code example that we don't need, remove all the code inside the the file `poetic_sock_seller.py`

## Activating the Plugin
Now got to the `Plugin` tab of the Admin Portal, your empty plugin will be there, activate it:

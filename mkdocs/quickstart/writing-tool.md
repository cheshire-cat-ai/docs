# Writing the first Tool

Tools are Python functions called by the LLM to execute actions. They are composed of two parts: the first part contains instructions to the LLM that explain when and how to call them, while the second part contains the actual code to execute.

## Creating the Tool
Now letâ€™s get down to business. A real socks salesman offers a quantity of socks, with many colors and corresponding price. Letâ€™s say a customer wants to know the price for socks of a specific color. We could write a tool to answer the question, copy and past this source code inside the file `poetic_sock_seller.py`:

```python
from cat.mad_hatter.decorators import tool

@tool
def socks_prices(color, cat):
    """How much do socks cost? Input is the sock color."""
    prices = {
        "black": 5,
        "white": 10,
        "pink": 50,
    }
    if color not in prices.keys():
        return f"No {color} socks"
    else:
        return f"{prices[color]} â‚¬" 
```

## Testing the Tool
Now letâ€™s ask for our favorite socks color:

## Why the response?
By clicking on the question mark next to the answer, you can understand what prompted the Cat to provide the response; in this case, you can see that our tool "socks_prices" was used:

## Explaining the code step by step
```python
from cat.mad_hatter.decorators import tool
```

Letâ€™s import from the Cat the tool decorator. If you donâ€™t know what decorators are in coding, donâ€™t worry: they will help us attach our python functions to the Cat. The mad_hatter is the Cat component that manages and runs plugins.

```python
@tool
def socks_prices(color, cat):
    """How much do socks cost? Input is the sock color."""
```

We define a function called "socks_prices," which takes as input the color of the desired socks and a cat instance.

The `@tool()` decorator has the main function of letting the Cat know that the following function is a tool.

The docstring just after the function signature reads as follows:

>"How much do socks cost? Input is the sock color."

This description instructs the LLM on when to call this tool and also helps determine what input to provide.

Going back to the tool actual code:

```python
    prices = {
        "black": 5,
        "white": 10,
        "pink": 50,
    }

    if color not in prices.keys():
        return f"No {color} socks"
    else:
        return f"{prices[color]} â‚¬" 
```

Not much to say here: we just check if the color is present in the dictionary, and output the price.
What is indeed interesting, is that in a tool you can connect your AI to any service, database, file, device, or whatever you need. Imagine turning on and off the light in your room, or searching an e-commerce, or writing an email. The only limit is your fantasy ðŸ™‚

## WatchFiles detected changes... reloading...

When changes to the plugin's source code are detected, the Cat is restarted. Feel free to make changes within the code and observe the results.

## Debugging

Sometimes debugging can be necessary. Please refer to the `Developers -> Debugging` section for more information.

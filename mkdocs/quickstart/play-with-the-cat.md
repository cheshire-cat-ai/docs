# Play with the Cat

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the Cat is installed and running, and that LLM is configured.

## Chatting with the Cat, the Admin Portal playground

The Cat is an API-first framework, it doesn't provide a ready-to-use UI for the end user, it is your responsibility to implement this UI. However, the Cat does offer a playground that you can use to quickly test the AI you are implementing.

To access playground go to the Admin Portal at `localhost:1865/admin`, and then click on the `Home` tab. This tab serves as the playground for chatting with the Cat. 

Try to ask something about socks, "what do you know about socks?" The Cat will respond with a generic answer directly generated by the LLM without Cat intervention. Afterwards, we will expand this general knowledge with more specific information.

You have learn how to use the playground for tests your AI via the Admin Portal.

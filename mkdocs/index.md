# &#128075; Hello, dear!

## What is this?

The Cheshire Cat is an open-source framework that allows you to develop intelligent agents on top of many
[Large Language Models](conceptual/llm.md) (LLM).
You can develop your custom AI architecture to assist you in a wide range of tasks.

The Cheshire Cat embeds a [long-term memory](conceptual/memory/long_term_memory.md) system to save the user's input locally
and it answers knowing the context of previous conversations.
You can also feed text documents in the Cat's memory system to enrich the agent's contextual information and ask it to
retrieve them further in the conversation.
The Cat currently supports `.txt`, `.pdf` and `.md` files.

If you want the Cat to solve tailored tasks you can extend its capabilities writing Python [plugins](technical/plugins/plugins.md)
to execute custom functions or call external services (e.g. APIs and other models).

If you want to build your custom AI architecture, the Cat can help you!

## Get started now!

For a quick onboarding we suggest you this learning journey:  

1 - read `Quickstart -> Overview`, this is an introduction to the main concepts behind the Cat  

2 - continue with the next steps under `Quickstart`, these are hands-on tutorials, you will have the first contact using the Cat, you will discover how to install, configure, interact, write you first nice `tool` and `hook`  

3 - enhance your knowledge of the Cat with the `How the Cat works`, this sections contains a deep concepts (se sei a digiuno di concetti di LLM AI quali il prompt e xxx ti consigliamo di sbirciare prima la sezione `LLM Concepts`)  

Now go! frase incitante...

    "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
    "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
    "I don't much care where--" said Alice.
    "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.

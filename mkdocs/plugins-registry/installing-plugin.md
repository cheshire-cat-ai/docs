## Manual Installation

For those inclined towards manual installation, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Zip**: Access the plugin of interest [in the registry](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/plugins) following the GitHub URL and download its zip file.
2. **Upload**: In the top right corner of the Plugins page, locate and click the "Upload Plugin" button.
3. **Upload Zip**: Upload the downloaded zip file using this feature.

Manual installation grants users more control over the process and facilitates the installation of specific plugins outside the registry itself.

## Post-Installation Steps

After installing a plugin, consider these steps:

- **Refresh**: Manually refresh the page in your browser after a few moments. This ensures any freshly installed plugins display accurately within the dashboard.
- **Settings Configuration**: If the newly installed plugin requires setup or configuration, look for the cog icon associated with the plugin. Click on it to access and adjust the plugin's settings according to your preferences.

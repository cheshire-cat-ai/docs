# &#128075; Hello, dear!

## What is this?

The Cheshire Cat is an open-source framework that allows you to develop intelligent agents on top of many
[Large Language Models](conceptual/llm.md) (LLM).
You can develop your custom AI architecture to assist you in a wide range of tasks.

The Cheshire Cat embeds a long-term memory system to save the user's input locally
and it answers knowing the context of previous conversations.
You can also feed text documents in the Cat's memory system to enrich the agent's contextual information and ask it to
retrieve them further in the conversation.

If you want the Cat to solve tailored tasks, you can extend its capabilities writing Python plugins
to execute custom functions or call external services (e.g., APIs and other models).

Furthermore, the Cat boasts a rapidly growing ecosystem of ready-to-use plugins that can be easily installed with just a click.

It is an API-first framework, making it seamlessly integrable with your pre-existing product.

If you want to build your custom AI architecture, the Cat can help you!

## Try it out now!

We have a Discord server, and we use the Cat as our assistant to provide support. You can give the Cat a try by connecting to the [:fontawesome-brands-discord: Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/1092359754917089350/1092360285056159814), mentioning `@Cheshire Cat AI` while asking something about the documentation, such as "Can I extend the Cat with plugins?" 

_if you're curious about how it's implemented, check out the [Discord use case](use-cases/discord-bot.md)_

## Get started now!

For a quick onboarding, we suggest this learning journey to you:  

1. Start by reading `Quickstart -> Introduction`. This is an overview of the main concepts behind the Cat.  

2. Next, continue with the subsequent steps under `Quickstart`. These are hands-on tutorials. You will have the first contact using the Cat and you will discover how to install, configure, interact, write your first useful `Tool` and setup `Hooks`.  

3. Further, enhance your understanding of the Cat with the `How the Cat works`. This section delves into deeper concepts. If you are new to LLM AI concepts, e.g. `Prompts` and `Language model chains`, we recommend checking out the `LLM Concepts` before reading this section.

4. Last but not least, in the `Developers` section, you can find all the necessary Cat references.

Now, go and create your first invaluable Cat-powered product!

    "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
    "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
    "I don't much care where--" said Alice.
    "Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.

# Play with the Cat

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the Cat is installed and running, and that LLM is configured.

## Chatting with the Cat, the Admin Portal playground

The Cat is an API-first framework, it doesn't provide a ready-to-use UI for the end user, it is your responsibility to implement this UI. However, the Cat does offer a playground that you can use to quickly test the AI you are implementing.

To access playground go to the Admin Portal at `localhost:1865/admin`, and then click on the `Home` tab. This tab serves as the playground for chatting with the Cat. 

Try to ask something about socks, "what do you know about socks?" The Cat will respond with a generic answer directly generated by the LLM without Cat intervention.

You have learn how to use the playground for tests your AI via the Admin Portal.

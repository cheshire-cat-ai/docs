# &#128075; Hello, Dear

> Good documentation is *key* to a good software and at Cheshire Cat AI we are always looking for great community members that are willing to improve it with their writing skills. This README as well as all the documentation you can find about the [Cat](https://cheshire-cat-ai.github.io/docs/) is the result of an effort between our Core team and a great Community. Remember to always have fun and be kind. 

For those who shall use the cat for the good, here's a lucky wish: "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail" (Ralph Waldo Emerson).

## üìö How to Contribute Documentation

1. Fork the repository.
2. Using Markdown syntax, edit or create new files for the documentation in the `/mkdocs` directory.
3. Use **headings**, **bullet points** or **numbered lists**, **code blocks** and other formatting tools to make the documentation easy to read and understand.
4. Use clear and concise language to explain the features, functions or concepts that are being documented.
5. Use hyperlinks, images or other visual aids to enhance the documentation.
6. Use the appropriate `/assets` folder for your static assets. Eg. Images goes under `/assets/img`.
7. Add a new item or adjust menu levels through the `mkdocs.yml` file if you have made any structural modifications.
8. When finished, commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
9. Open a pull request and ask for feedback from the community.
10. Keep your contributions up-to-date with any changes or updates made to the main repository.

There is a [dedicated channel for Docs on our official Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1092359754917089350/1092360068269359206), don't be shy and contact us there if you need help!

## ü§π Manage the tecnology [mkdocs]

To modify the behavior of MkDocs and its plugins, everything you need is within the `mkdocs.yml` file.  
We invite you to read the documentation for the [MkDocs Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) to fully understand all the potential of the tool and how to make the most of its extensive features.

### üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pip 20+

Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### üõ†Ô∏è Develop

`mkdocs serve` or `python -m mkdocs serve` will launch a local, non static, instance of the documentation website.

### üñåÔ∏è Diagrams

All the diagrams under the "Framework/Technical Diagrams" section have been created using draw.io.
The file [drawio-cheshire-cat-library](drawio-cheshire-cat-library.xml) is a draw.io library, it contains some custom Cat shapes, this library has been created to speed up the sketching, you can use it opening the file with draw.io.
You can refer to the draw.io files with the extension `.drawio`, directly from the markdown files like this:

```mk
# &#128572; The Cat Bootstrap

This interactive diagram, zoomable with a click, depicts the internal process involved during bootstrap of the Cat:

![](../../assets/diagrams/cat-bootstrap.drawio)
```

In the `mkdocs.yml` there is defined the hook `drawio_file.py`, this mkdocs plugin converts the drawio files during the build time:

```mk
hooks:
  - mkdocs/hooks/drawio_file.py
```
  
Remember that:

- the tab selected during the save of the draw.io file, will become the initial page when the diagram is opened

- the layers visible during the save of the draw.io files, will be the default visible layers when the diagram is opened
  
- by default, the hooks shapes have to be visible
  
- the folder `mkdocs/assets/img/diagrams` contains the svg files used in the main diagram pages, in case you change the diagrams remember to update them.

### üèóÔ∏è Build

The build stage is automated using GitHub action, you don't need to do it in order to contribute. However, if you want to have a static copy of the documentation on your local machine you are free to do it.  

`mkdocs build` or `python -m mkdocs build` will create the actual docs static website in a folder named `/docs`.

# &#128640; Stopping the Cat

## Stopping the Cat

When you're done using the Cat, stop the terminal by clicking on it and press `CTRL + c`.  Then launch the command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

We want to remind you that Long Term Memory is a locally persisted memory. When you restart the Cat, all conversation history and uploaded documents will still be there.
